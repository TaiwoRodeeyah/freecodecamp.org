            <h3>Here's a timeline of Funmilayo <strike>Ransome-kuti</strike> Anikulapo-Kuti's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Born <time datetime="1900/25/10">October 25, 1900</time> in Abeokuta, Ogun state</li>
                <li>Fumilayo Ransome-Kuti was the first female student to attend the Abeokuta Grammar School.</li>
                <li><strong>1932 -</strong> Ransome-Kuti had helped establish the Abeokuta Ladies Club.The club focused on charity work, sewing, catering and adult education classes, and its early members were mostly Christian, Western-educated women from the middle class</li>
                <li><strong>1944 -</strong> She developed a successful campaign to stop local authorities seizing rice from market women under false pretenses.</li>
                <li><strong>1946 -</strong> The club was formally renamed the Abeokuta Women's Union (AWU), now open to all women in Abeokuta. The organisation now turned its focus to fighting unfair price controls and taxes imposed on market women, with Ransome-Kuti as the AWU's president. She had founded the union along with Grace Eniola Soyinka (her husband's niece and the mother of Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka), and the AWU gradually grew to represent 20,000 official members, with up to 100,000 additional supporters. In an effort to unify women and avoid class conflict, Ransome-Kuti and other formally educated members spoke Yoruba and wore traditional Yoruba clothing to union meetings and events.</li>
                <li><strong>1947 -</strong> The National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons party (NCNC) sent a delegation to London, England, to protest a proposed Nigerian constitution. Ransome-Kuti was the sole woman in the delegation. While in London, Ransome-Kuti gave speeches about Nigerian women's issues at the London Women's Parliamentary Committee, the National Federation of Women's Institutes, and other organizations. She also caused a stir after writing an article for the Daily Worker that argued colonial rule had <q>severely marginalized</q> Nigerian women both politically and economically</li>
                <li><strong>1949 -</strong> She proposed the creation of the Nigerian Women's Union (NWU) in order to better support women's rights and enfranchisement across the country. The AWU supported her proposal, and the organisation subsequently became the Abeokuta branch of the NWU. Over the next several years, Ransome-Kuti travelled widely to help set up NWU branches in towns and cities all over Nigeria. She served as president of both the NWU and her hometown union in Abeokuta. The NWU pursued goals of achieving women's suffrage, dismantling electoral colleges, and supporting a more balanced representation of women in politics</li>
                <li><strong>1953 -</strong> She organized a conference in Abeokuta to discuss women's suffrage and political representation, and 400 women delegates attended the two-day event. The participants subsequently formed the Federation of Nigerian Women's Societies (FNWS).The <abbr title="Federation of Nigerian Women's Societies">FNWS</abbr> campaigned for women's political inclusion, improved educational opportunities, and the creation of new social services and healthcare.</li>
                <li><strong>1965 -</strong> Ransome-Kuti received the national honour of membership in the Order of the Niger. The University of Ibadan bestowed an honorary doctorate of laws upon her in 1968, and she received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1970.</li>
                <li><strong>1969 -</strong> She was appointed chairman of the Advisory Board of Education by the western Nigeria state government, and she served as a consultant to the Federal Ministry of Education on recruitment of teachers from other countries.</li>
                <li>Inspired by her son Fela, who had altered his surname to reflect a discarding of colonial European influences, Ransome-Kuti informally changed her surname to <q>Anikulapo-Kuti</q> during the early 1970s. The name <q>Anikulapo</q> is a Yoruba word and can be translated to mean <q>hunter who carries death in a pouch</q> or <q>warrior who carries strong protection</q></li>
                <li>She died on 13 April 1978</li>
            </ul>
